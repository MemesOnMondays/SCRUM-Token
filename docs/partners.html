<h2>PARTNERS</h2>

<p class="text-bold">The SCRUM memecoin is launched by the <a href="https://memesonmondays.com" target="_blank">MemesOnMondays</a> initiative</p>
<p>These dynamic web3 enthusiasts specialize in giving form and life to the unique ideas of founders, influencers, and marketers who wish to tap into the world of digital assets, enabling them to launch their own tokens to a thriving community.</p>

<p class="text-italic">Our strategic partners bring invaluable contributions to each project we undertake. They enrich our ecosystem with fresh insights and perspectives to help mold the narrative surrounding each memecoin's adoption and growth.</p>

<p class="text-small">We typically charge a retainer fee upfront, however if you can bring unique value, reach and vision to a project, our team is open to waiving the initial fee in favor of nurturing what could be a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>

<p>So if you can provide investment, influence and marketing, or can write the best contract code, we'd be thrilled to hear from you! Do not hesitate to get in touch â€“ you can slide into our <a href="https://twitter.com/MemesOnMondays" target="_blank">DMs on Twitter</a> and a member of the @MemesOnMondays team will connect with you. Join us and become a part of the exciting, ever-evolving world of memecoins. Your contribution could be the spark that fuels the viral success of our next launch!</p>
