<h2>TOKENOMICS</h2>

<p class="text-bold">The tokenomics of SCRUM are designed to promote rapid growth</p>

<img src="./distribution.png" class="distribution-chart" />

<p>Building on what we learnt from past launches we have sent 100% of the supply to Uniswap v2 and locked the LP tokens in the contract permanently.</p>

<p>Because Uniswap v2 uses balanced pools the starting price will be very low which <span class="text-bold">enables a lot of upside potential</span>. We hope will attract early adopters to the project. The <span class="text-bold">total supply is 1 Billion tokens all of which will be sent to the Uniswap pool.</p>

<p>There is a 1% transfer tax which will be sent to the MemesOnMondays team, this ensures aligned motivation and gives them a vested interest in the token's success.</p>

<p class="text-bold">Contract ownership is renounced, verified on Etherscan, open source code and no functions to remove liquidity</p>

<p>Our mission at MemesOnMondays is to create a billion dollar market cap memecoin. Read more about it here: <a href="https://memesonmondays.com/p/mission" target="_blank">https://memesonmondays.com/p/mission</a></p>
